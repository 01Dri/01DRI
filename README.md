# README

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Diego, a beginner in web development, and this is where I showcase my projects and skills.

## Stack
I primarily work with the Java programming language and have experience in developing applications using the Spring framework. Although I have a good understanding of Java, I have also dabbled in Python, although my knowledge in Python is not as extensive.

Here are some of the technologies and languages I work with:

- Java
